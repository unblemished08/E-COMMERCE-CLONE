                    <ul>
                    <p>An iconic Indian industrialist, Ratan Tata, has been a stalwart of the Indian business ecosystem. Born in Mumbai in the famed Tata family, he served as the chairman of Tata Sons and of the Tata Group (from 1990 to 2012, and 2016-17.) Felicitated with the highest civilian awards of India, the Padma Vibhushan (2008) and Padma Bhushan (2000),</p>

                        <p>Tata has been a philanthropist and an active investor in the Indian start-up community. He was instrumental in many of the pivotal acquisitions (Tetley, Jaguar Land Rover, Corus, Air India) that ushered an era of modernity and competitiveness in this revered business group.</p>

                        <p> Retired from the Indian Air Force at a young age, A.K. Gandhi stormed the world of literature with his innovative style and novel ideas and untraditional ways of research to bring out the popular books now he is known for. Presently, he works as a freelance author and translator, with a number of works to his credit in both capacities. He writes in both Hindi and English.</p>
