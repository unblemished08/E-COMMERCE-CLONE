<h2>
    The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn
                    </h2>

                    <ul>
                        <p>Huck is back.. Taken for a son by Widow Douglas; struggling against the society and its attempts to ‘civilize’ him.Escaping his alcoholic father by faking his death, we join him as he voyages down the Mississippi River seeking liberation. Finding his way to Jackson’s island he meets Jim, Mrs. Watson’s runaway slave. What happens as they team up, capture a raft and encounter a seemingly haphazard array of people and situations? </p>

                        <p>  Immersed in deadly violence, finding tranquility only on the river with Jim, will Huckleberry Finn find the freedom and independence he is seeking? A direct sequel to the Adventures of Tom Sawyer, it traces Huck’s moral development as he moves from having an unthinking acceptance of received knowledge and values to developing an independently achieved understanding of what is right.</p>

                        <p>.A scathing satire on entrenched attitudes, Twain’s the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn defines the American Dream of young heroes. Sometimes ironic, sometimes mocking, sometimes boyish and exuberant, it is named among the Great American Novels. </p>
